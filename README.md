# UnicodeGame

So how does it work?

## UnicodeGame - Numbers

You start with a number and you need to add up the numbers you have to reach it

Those numbers are: 
1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128

For anyone who's good at maths, you may have noticed some things:
- These numbers are powers of 2
- These numbers also represent the possible combinations of a Byte, how all data is saved and processed

### The rules

When the page loads, It will give you a Number Goal to reach. 
Tick the numbers below it to add up to reach that goal, the Current Number will help you reach that number.
Have fun!

### How to play

(Tested and works in VSCode on Windows)

1. Clone this repository into your chosen IDE
2. Run the following commands (Make sure you have Node/NPM installed prior)
```
npm install
npm run build
npm run open (open index.html if on mac)
```

## UnicodeGame - Typing Trouble

!!!!WIP!!!!

You're texting your mate and oh no! The keyboard on your phone is broken and you can only type in binary! Luckly your phone still understands unicode so it'll be a little more difficult to text your mates. 

Same gameplay as the Numbers version with some better CSS on the way for both
