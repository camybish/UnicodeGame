# UnicodeGame

So how does it work?

## UnicodeGame - Numbers

You start with a number and you need to add up the numbers you have to reach it

Those numbers are: 
1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128

For anyone who's good at maths you may have noticed somethings:
- These numbers are powers of 2
- These numbers also represent the possible combinations of a Byte, how all data is saved and processed

### The rules

Chose whatever numbers you like to sum up to achieve the goal number. You can use any number once.

## UnicodeGame - Typing Trouble

!!!!WIP!!!!

You're texting your mate and oh no! The keyboard on your phone is broken and you can only type in binary! Luckly your phone still understands unicode so it'll be a little more difficult to text your mates. 

Same gameplay as the Numbers version with some better CSS on the way for both
